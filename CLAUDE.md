# BakerOS — CLAUDE.md

## What this repo is

Arch Linux tooling for the_baker's fleet of machines. Every machine starts from a live ISO and runs through three scripts in sequence to reach a fully configured desktop.

GitHub: `github.com/Dequavis-Fitzgerald-III/baker`

**Current version: 1.1.0** — see `VERSION` and `ROADMAP.md` for the versioning scheme and plan.

## Script Flow

```
install.sh  →  (reboot)  →  post-install.sh  →  (reboot)  →  post-reboot.sh
     ↓                                                               ↓
configure.sh                                                  [system running]
  (called from                                                       ↓
   chroot)                                                    baker-update  ← run anytime to sync
                                                                     ↓
                                                              configure.sh
                                                               (called by
                                                               upgrade.sh)
```

### `install.sh`
Run from the Arch live ISO as root. Interactive questions upfront (profile, hostname, CPU/GPU, timezone, disk, dual boot, LUKS, dotfiles repo), then fully unattended from the confirmation onwards.

Sections:
1. Interactive questions
2. Partitioning (GPT, EFI + root, LUKS optional)
3. LUKS setup (luks2, opens as `cryptroot`) — also computes `LUKS_UUID` via `blkid`
4. Format + mount
5. `pacstrap` — fetches `packages/base.txt` + `packages/<profile>.txt` from the repo, adds bootstrap packages (kernel, bootloader, ucode, GPU drivers) on top, installs everything
6. `fstab` generation (+ optional secondary HDD entry)
7. `arch-chroot` — bootstrap only: passwords, user creation, `grub-install`, services, then calls `configure.sh` via curl
8. Write `.baker-config`
9. Download `post-install.sh` + `post-reboot.sh`

Key design decisions:
- EFI mounted at `/boot` (single boot) or `/boot/efi` (dual boot) to avoid clobbering the Windows bootloader
- `kms` hook excluded from mkinitcpio when GPU is Nvidia (avoids black screen)
- `sshd` hardened from first boot via `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/99-baker.conf` (key-only auth, no passwords)

### `configure.sh`
Applies all idempotent system configuration. Called by `install.sh` (inside the chroot, vars passed via environment) and by `upgrade.sh` (on a live system, reads `.baker-config`). Safe to run at any time — checks current state before making changes.

Covers: timezone, locale, console keymap, hostname (`/etc/hostname` + `/etc/hosts`), sudo, hyprland-welcome removal, HDD mount point, mkinitcpio HOOKS + initramfs rebuild (only if HOOKS changed), GRUB cmdline + timeout + dual boot + `grub-mkconfig` (only if config changed), sshd hardening drop-in.

Everything configure.sh does is driven by a key in `.baker-config` — edit a value and run `baker-update` to apply it.

### `post-install.sh`
Run as the regular user after first boot. Reads `.install-config` written by `install.sh`.

Sections:
1. Network check (auto-wifi on laptop using saved credentials)
2. Install `yay` (AUR helper)
3. AUR packages — reads `[aur]` section from `packages/base.txt` via curl
4. Chrome flags (disable keyring prompt)
5. Flatpak packages — reads `[flatpak]` section from `packages/base.txt` via curl
6. Home directory setup: clone `baker` + dotfiles repos over HTTPS, symlink dotfiles
7. NordVPN group + service setup
8. Locale/timezone confirmation via `localectl`/`timedatectl`
9. Services: NetworkManager, sddm, ufw, pipewire (user), laptop extras
10. SSH: generate ed25519 keypair, add to GitHub, configure git SSH rewrite, register key in `baker/keys/`, rebuild `authorized_keys` + `~/.ssh/config`, commit + push key to repo

Self-deletes on completion, then reboots.

### `post-reboot.sh`
Short final script run after the post-install reboot.

1. Tailscale login (`tailscale up`, browser flow) — must happen before NordVPN connects, otherwise NordLynx captures the default route and breaks the Tailscale auth browser flow.
2. NordVPN login (browser flow) + set autoconnect (us). No killswitch — NordLynx (WireGuard) + Tailscale (WireGuard) conflict at the routing level and the killswitch breaks Tailscale entirely.
3. `.bashrc` additions: `WORKON_HOME`, `baker-update` alias, todo checklist hook
4. Writes `~/.todo` with remaining manual steps

Self-deletes on completion.

## Key Registry — `keys/`

`keys/` is the_baker fleet key registry. Each install copies `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` to `keys/<hostname>.pub` and commits + pushes it.

`authorized_keys` and `~/.ssh/config` are rebuilt from whatever `.pub` files exist in the directory — the machine list is derived from the repo, not hardcoded anywhere.

`~/.ssh/config` uses Tailscale MagicDNS short names (`Hostname nomadbaker`) so SSH across the_baker's fleet works once Tailscale is up, without any further config.

### `sync-baker-keys.sh`
Run on existing machines when a new machine joins. Pulls the repo and rebuilds `authorized_keys` + `~/.ssh/config`.

---

## Package Manifests — `packages/`

Single source of truth for what's installed on baker machines. Both `install.sh` and `upgrade.sh` read from these files — add a package once and it flows to fresh installs and existing machines alike.

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `packages/base.txt` | All profiles — `[pacman]`, `[aur]`, `[flatpak]` sections |
| `packages/workstation.txt` | pearlybaker extras — `[pacman]` section |
| `packages/laptop.txt` | nomadbaker extras — `[pacman]` section |

Bootstrap packages (kernel, bootloader, ucode, GPU drivers) are hardcoded in `install.sh` only — they are install-time or hardware-specific and don't belong in the manifests.

### `upgrade.sh`
Run on any live baker machine to converge it to the current desired state. Safe to run at any time — all steps are idempotent. Accessible via the `baker-update` alias added to `.bashrc` by `post-reboot.sh`.

1. Pull latest baker repo
2. `pacman -Syu` — full system upgrade
3. Install missing pacman packages from manifests (`--needed` skips already-installed)
4. Install missing AUR packages
5. Install missing Flatpak packages
6. Pull dotfiles + re-symlink
7. Ensure services enabled
8. Rebuild SSH config via `sync-baker-keys.sh`
9. Sync `.baker-config` — re-detects hardware (GPU, LUKS, HDD, dual boot) and rewrites file
10. Run `configure.sh` — converges system config to the freshly synced `.baker-config`

### `.baker-config`
Permanent machine config file written by `install.sh` to `~/.baker-config`. Persists across reboots and is never deleted. Has two sections:

**System Config (editable)** — change a value and run `baker-update` to apply:
`HOSTNAME`, `TIMEZONE`, `LOCALE`, `KEYMAP`, `DOTFILES_URL`

**Hardware (auto-detected, do not edit)** — reflects physical machine reality, reset on every update:
`USERNAME`, `PROFILE`, `GPU`, `LUKS`, `LUKS_UUID`, `HDD`, `HDD_MOUNT`, `DUAL_BOOT`

## Known Issues / Future Work

- **ringbaker** — home server not yet built. When it joins the_baker's fleet it will need its own profile in `install.sh` (server profile: no desktop packages, no NordVPN — Tailscale-only).
- **`TEMP_JARVIS_DEV_SETUP.md`** — temporary file for Jarvis AI project dev environment setup on nomadbaker. Delete when Jarvis moves to the server.

## Network DNS Notes

Some networks (confirmed: Newcastle University) block Tailscale's domains (`login.tailscale.com`, `controlplane.tailscale.com`) at the DNS level. Symptoms:
- `tailscale up` browser auth page fails to load (`ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED`)
- Tailscale health warning: "hasn't received a network map from the coordination server"
- Chicken-and-egg on machines already using Tailscale MagicDNS (`100.100.100.100`) as their DNS — Tailscale DNS goes down when Tailscale loses the control server

`post-reboot.sh` handles this automatically by testing DNS resolution before `tailscale up` and overriding to `8.8.8.8` if needed. On an existing machine, manual fix: `echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf && sudo systemctl restart tailscaled`.

## Conventions

- Explain everything: before running any command or making any change, explain what it does in plain terms. Never assume prior knowledge of a tool, flag, or concept.
- One section at a time: explain the change, then write it, so each step can be reviewed before continuing.
- No co-author lines in git commits.
- Commit messages: conventional commits style (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:` etc.).
- All scripts use `set -e` and the same colour/logging helpers (`info`, `success`, `warn`, `error`, `section`).
- HTTPS for all clones in `post-install.sh` (no SSH key needed yet); git URL rewrite configured at the end of Section 10 so everything switches to SSH after that.
- **Naming convention:** commands use kebab-case (`baker-update`, `sync-baker-keys`); scripts use kebab-case (`post-install.sh`, `post-reboot.sh`); config files use underscore (`.baker_config`, `the_baker.conf`).
- **the_baker/user split:** `the_baker` is the role for whoever operates the_baker's fleet. `user` is anyone running BakerOS without a the_baker token. the_baker-specific steps and packages are gated on the the_baker token.

## Fix Workflow

When making a fix, follow this sequence:

1. **Read the docs** — understand the relevant man pages, upstream docs, or Arch Wiki before touching anything.
2. **Explain the fix** — describe what's changing and why before writing it, so it can be reviewed and understood fully.
3. **Make the fix** — same rules as always: `set -e`, colour helpers, conventional commit style, one section at a time.
4. **Commit and push** — descriptive conventional commit message; no co-author lines.
5. **Update context** — if the fix changes how something works, update `CLAUDE.md` to reflect it. If the session surfaced useful context that doesn't belong in `CLAUDE.md`, capture it in a dev notes file.
